"""Hermes-callable surface for the source-trust ceiling.

Hermes learns what OMH *describes* from installed skill prose, but the
source-trust ceiling is a mechanical guard, and a guard that only exists in
prose is the thing `omh.workflows.source_trust` was written to replace. This
tool is the path where Hermes hands over the claims it gathered and OMH actually
runs the ceiling on them, rather than asking a model to remember a rule.

Fail-closed on degradation, which is the one design decision here worth stating.
Every other tool in this bundle answers from a standalone fallback when the
`omh` package is not importable, because a partial answer beats no answer for
status, routing hints, or capability listings. A ceiling is different: an
enforcement surface that cannot enforce must not return something a reader can
mistake for an enforced result. So when the backend is missing this returns
`degraded: true`, no summary, and says the ceiling did not run.
